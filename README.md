Kapalina liquidator bot for eth AMMs. 
This example liquidator bot is similar to the previous example, but it includes additional code to interact with an Ethereum AMM contract using the Web3j library. This allows the bot to sell assets on the AMM contract when liquidation is triggered. As with the previous example, this is just one possible approach to liquidation, and a real-world liquidator bot would likely be much more complex and sophisticated. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only.
