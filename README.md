Kapalina liquidator bot for eth AMMs. 
This example liquidator bot is similar to the previous example, but it includes additional code to interact with an Ethereum AMM contract using the Web3j library. This allows the bot to sell assets on the AMM contract when liquidation is triggered. As with the previous example, this is just one possible approach to liquidation, and a real-world liquidator bot would likely be much more complex and sophisticated. This example is provided for illustrative purposes only.


Introduction
The LiquidatorBot class is a simple Java implementation of a liquidator bot that can be used to automatically liquidate assets when certain conditions are met. The bot can be used with any type of assets, but it is specifically designed to work with Ethereum Automated Market Makers (AMMs) in the second example.

Requirements
To use the LiquidatorBot class, you will need the following:

Java 8 or later
Maven for managing dependencies (optional, but recommended)
If you want to use the second example that is designed to work with Ethereum AMMs, you will also need the following:

The Web3j library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain
An Ethereum wallet with enough funds to pay for transaction fees on the blockchain
The address of an Ethereum AMM contract that you want to use
Installation
To use the LiquidatorBot class, you will need to clone or download the Java source code from this repository and compile it into a JAR file. If you are using Maven, you can run the following command to compile the code and generate the JAR file:

mvn clean compile assembly:single

If you are not using Maven, you can use the javac command to compile the Java source files into class files, and then use the jar command to create the JAR file.

Once the JAR file has been generated, you can add it to your Java project and import the LiquidatorBot class into your code.

Usage
To use the LiquidatorBot class, you will need to create an instance of the class and provide it with the necessary information, such as the current value of the fund and the current holdings of the fund. For example:
// Set the current value of the fund
double fundValue = 1000000.0;

// Set the current holdings of the fund
Map<String, Double> holdings = new HashMap<>();
holdings.put("ETH", 500.0);
holdings.put("DAI", 5000.0);

// Create a new instance of the LiquidatorBot class
LiquidatorBot bot = new LiquidatorBot(fundValue, holdings);

Once the LiquidatorBot instance has been created, you can use the checkHoldings method to check the current value of the fund's holdings, and trigger liquidation if necessary. For example:
// Check the current value of the fund's holdings
bot.checkHoldings();

Configuration
The LiquidatorBot class has several configurable parameters that can be adjusted to suit your specific requirements. These parameters are listed below:

LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD: This is the ratio of the fund's holdings to its total value that will trigger liquidation. The default value is 0.8, which means that liquidation will be triggered if the value of the fund's holdings falls below 80% of the fund's


total value. This parameter can be adjusted by changing the value of the LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD constant at the top of the LiquidatorBot class.

ammAddress: This is the Ethereum address of the AMM contract that will be used to sell assets during liquidation. This parameter is only used in the second example, and it can be provided when creating an instance of the LiquidatorBot class, as shown in the example below:
// Set the Ethereum address of the AMM contract
String ammAddress = "0x123456789...";

// Set the current value of the fund
double fundValue = 1000000.0;

// Set the current holdings of the fund
Map<String, Double> holdings = new HashMap<>();
holdings.put("ETH", 500.0);
holdings.put("DAI", 5000.0);

// Create a new instance of the LiquidatorBot class
LiquidatorBot bot = new LiquidatorBot(ammAddress, fundValue, holdings);
fundValue: This is the current value of the fund. It is used to calculate the ratio of the fund's holdings to its total value, which determines when liquidation is triggered. This parameter is provided when creating an instance of the LiquidatorBot class, as shown in the examples above.

holdings: This is a map of the fund's current holdings, where the keys are the names of the assets and the values are the quantities of each asset that the fund holds. This parameter is provided when creating an instance of the LiquidatorBot class, as shown in the examples above.

Limitations
The LiquidatorBot class is a simple implementation of a liquidator bot, and it should not be used in a real-world setting without further development and testing. Some of the limitations of the current implementation are as follows:

The executeLiquidation method in the first example does not actually sell any assets. This method will need to be implemented in order for the bot to be able to sell assets in a real-world setting.

The sellAssetOnAMM method in the second example is a placeholder that does not actually sell assets on an Ethereum AMM contract. This method will need to be implemented in order for the bot to be able to sell assets on an AMM contract in a real-world setting.

The LiquidatorBot class does not include any error handling or logging, which means that it may not be able to handle unexpected errors or provide any useful information if something goes wrong.

The LiquidatorBot class does not include any security measures, such as authentication or authorization, which means that it may not be secure to use in a real-world setting.

Overall, the LiquidatorBot class should be considered a starting point for developing a more sophisticated and robust liquidator bot, rather than a complete and ready-to-use solution.
